# Learn Data Engineering

This repo contains several basic concepts, description of tools as well as how we apply them to solve problems. The contents are from courses on Youtube, Udemy etc. The intent is to set up a knowledge base for me (and hopefully others in the future) to get better understanding of data enigneering concepts. I will try to learn concepts, takes some notes and push to this repo daily as I want to grow myself a little bit every day :). Stay tuned!

The topics range from software fevelopment strategies to machine learning based image processing.
